              A tiered rewards opportunity is one that defines ranges of
              redemption values that are available when a minimum amount of
              rewards currency (typically, miles) has been accumulated. For
              example:            Redemption Value Miles Needed     $0.01 to
              $150 15,000   $150.01 to $350 35,000   $350.01 to $600 60,000  
              $600.01 and greater The cost of travel x 100     For a tiered
              redemption opportunity, the tierMinCashValue and tierMaxCashValue
              provide, respectively, the low and high dollar values that define
              the redemption range applicable to that opportunity. For the
              highest tier, no tierMaxCashValue is returned; the maximum is
              calculated based on the rewardsBalance or redemptionAmount (which
              will have the same value) and the redemptionRate, and provided in
              the cashValue property.   The array of redemptionOpportunities
              will include all those for which the current account balance
              renders the account eligible. For example, if a tiered travel
              program defined the tiers shown in the table above, and the
              rewardsBalance was 35,621 miles, the array of redemption
              opportunities would include one for the first tier (cash value
              range $0 to $150) and one for the second tier (cash value range
              $150.01 to $350). Redemption opportunities that fall into the two
              remaining tiers will not be included in the array, since the
              account isn’t currently eligible to redeem them.   Note that any
              redemption of a tiered opportunity that isn’t defined as the
              highest tier costs the full amount of currency specified, even if
              the value of the purchase is less than the maximum allowed. For
              example, in the program described above, a redemption of $200.00
              would reduce the account balance by the full 35,000 miles; the
              same number of miles would be required for a higher redemption (up
              to $350) and a lower one ($150.01 or more) in the same tier.   For
              a redemption opportunity that’s defined as the highest tier, the
              cost of the redemption in terms of account currency is calculated
              based on the redemptionRate assigned to the opportunity. See
              redemptionAmount.   These values are not provided for non-tiered
              opportunities.

              For a tiered opportunity, the minRedemptionAmount defines the
              amount of currency required for the tier (in the example above,
              the Miles Needed value).   For a non-tiered opportunity,
              minRedemptionAmount is returned if the program defines one — for
              example, if an automatic redemption program defines a minimum
              amount that can be redeemed. If the program does not define a
              minimum, no value is returned.   Note that this value is defined
              in units of the account’s rewardsCurrency (miles, points, or cash
              back).
          redemptionAmount:
            type: number
            description: >-
              The amount that can be redeemed for this opportunity given the
              account’s current rewardsBalance, expressed in terms of the
              rewardsCurrency (miles, points, or cash back).   For a non-tiered
              opportunity, redemptionAmount will be equal to minRedemptionAmount
              if a minRedemptionAmount is defined and its value is less than the
              rewardsBalance; otherwise, redemptionAmount will be equal to the
              rewardsBalance.   For a tiered opportunity that’s not in the
              highest tier, this value specifies the minimum balance required to
              qualify for a given tier, and also represents the amount of
              currency that will be deducted from the account for a redemption
              in the cash value range defined for that tier (see
              tierMinCashValue, tierMaxCashValue).   For an opportunity in the
              highest tier, this value is equal to rewardsBalance, and is not
              necessarily the amount of currency that will be deducted from the
              account for a redemption; in the highest tier, the cost of a
              redemption is calculated based on the defined redemptionRate.  
              For example, for the tiers illustrated above and a rewardsBalance
              of 65,000 miles:     for an opportunity in the first tier
              (redemption value up to $150), the redemptionAmount would be
              15,000 miles, and any redemption in the defined cash value range
              would cost the entire 15,000 miles, leaving a 50,000 mile balance;
              and   for an opportunity in the highest tier, the redemptionAmount
              would be 65,000 miles (the full rewardsBalance), but a redemption
              whose value is greater than $600.01 would cost only the actual
              value times 100: a flight that cost $625, for example, would
              reduce the account value by 62,500 miles, leaving a 2,500 mile
              balance.     Note that, for any tier except the highest tier, the
              redemptionAmount is not necessarily the same as the
              rewardsBalance, but the rewardsBalance will be equal to or higher
              than the redemptionAmount.   Always returned.
          redemptionRate:
            type: number
            description: >-
              The rate at which the account’s rewardsCurrency is converted to
              dollars and cents (US dollars, when Accept-Language is set to a US
              value; or Canadian dollars, when Accept-Language is set to a CA
              value). The calculated value is provided in the cashValue
              property.   This value is provided for all non-tiered
              subcategories, and for tiered subcategories (such as the
              highest-tiered subcategory, or some gift card tiered
              subcategories) that do not have a fixed redemptionAmount.  
              Currently, since en-US is the only supported value, all cash
              conversions will be to US dollars.
          cashValue:
            type: number
            description: >-
              The calculated cash value of the redemptionAmount.   For
              opportunities that have a redemptionRate defined, this value is
              determined by multiplying the redemptionAmount by the
              redemptionRate.   If no redemptionRate is defined, cashValue will
              be equal to tierMaxCashValue.   Always returned.
          cashDisplayValue:
            type: string
            description: >-
              The cashValue formatted as a string, with the appropriate currency
              indicator and localized number formatting (for example,
              $1,234.56).   Always returned.
